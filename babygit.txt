===============
= terminology =
===============

commit - a 'save point'
origin - GitHub
HEAD -> master - Where you are right now
NOTE: If you are not working with GitHub, anything with the word 'push' or 'pull' in it you can safely ignore! That means the only relevant commands are git save and git rollback(!)

==============
= idempotent =
==============

git status
• display what files have been changed, etc

git history
• display the commit history. Uses reflog so that branches beyond master are visible.

================
= basic saving =
================

git commits [MESSAGE]
• Saves a commit with a message

git push
• Pushes your unpushed commits to GitHub

git commitpush [MESSAGE]
• Combination of the save and push

git pull
• Pulls the latest commit(s) from GitHub. Rebase is set as the default instead of merge because it's more intuitive for beginners.

========================
= when things go wrong =
========================

git fixpush
• When someone else has already pushed and you try to push as well, GitHub will reject your push. fixpush will update (pull) the latest changes in first, thus allowing you to push. If the latest changes conflict with the changes you are about to push, there will be a merge conflict which you have to resolve before you can push.

git goto [COMMIT]
• Once something goes wrong you can rollback to a previous commit, using the commit's hash found by git history. (Note that rollback is not equivalent to checkout, because rollback doesn't go into detached head mode. It will always forcibly move master along with head)

git forcepush
• Forcibly make the repo on GitHub the same as yours

git forcepull
• Forcibly make your repo the same as the one on GitHub

git stache
• Stash whatever's in the current directory and make a copy on the desktop as well. Sometimes the best way to skirt around the merge issues is to copy the file to desktop, do a forcepull, then manually copy your desired changes over rather than fucking around with the merge system which is more trouble than it's worth to beginners.

git unstache
• git stash pop

git dropstache
• git stash drop

================
= useful tools =
================

git difference [optional COMMIT(S)]
(make sure difftool=vim and algorithm=patience, plus q for quitting :qa!)
• If no commits are provided, 'head' will be compared with the unsaved changes. If one commit is provided, that commit will be compared with 'head'. If both commits are provided, they are compared with each other.

git show [COMMIT]
• Display the code changes for a particular commit

git undocommit
• Undo the latest commit. Very useful when you have pushed a commit and realize you need to make one small change. Just undosave, save again then forcepush!

========
= Demo =
========

Demo 1: Save, save, save, rollback. All history is preserved (as a tree), so you can always find the right commit to rollback to.
commands - git save, git rollback
Demo 1.5: You make some changes, save and push. Later your friend makes another change and pushes, so you pull in his changes before making any more changes.
commands - git push, git savepush, git pullr

Demo 2: Writing, push, push rejected. Simply fixpush , dive into the code to remove merge conflict markers, and push again. Or, always remember to do a pullr before savepushing.
commands - git fixpush

Demo 3: Writing, savepush, oh no I need to make one small change! Simply undo, make changes, then save and forcepush.
(Drive home the point that as long as you're not merely adding commits to github, but rather modifying it in some way, you -WILL- have to do a forcepush. Such as after a rollback)
commands - git undosave, git forcepush
